# Intrinsically Motivated Reinforcement Learning

## Setup and Run
- Install dependencies: `pip install .` to install all packages defined in setup.py
- Run unit tests: `py.test -vv -s`
- Execute an experiment with `./imrl/utils/cli.py --episodes 6`

## Conventions
- Naming convention: Where stateful variables are named, such as a state `s` and next state `s'`, the first state will be named `state` and the second `state_prime`
